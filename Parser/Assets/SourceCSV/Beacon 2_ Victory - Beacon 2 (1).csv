BIRD,HAPPY,Up here!,
TROUBADOUR,NEUTRAL,"&The bird circles around the beacon, white wings beating in the air.",
TROUBADOUR,HAPPY,I see it!,
TROUBADOUR,HAPPY,"&Troubadour shields his eyes from the sun, peering up at the beacon and the bird.",
TROUBADOUR,HAPPY,"&He looks back at all of us, expectant and grinning.",
TROUBADOUR,HAPPY,Shall we?,
DREAMER,HAPPY,&I smile back and open my mouth to reply when-,
BLACKGUARD,ANNOYED,Can we get this over with already?,
BLACKGUARD,ANNOYED,"&I turn to see Blackguard looking annoyed (what's new, though), hanging behind the group, a direct contrast to Troubadour up ahead.",
LIGHTHOUSE,NEUTRAL,"&Lighthouse spares him a glance as well, unimpressed.",
LIGHTHOUSE,NEUTRAL,Got somewhere to be?,
NARRATION,NEUTRAL,&I think I see the corners of her mouth quirk up in a faint smirk.&,
BLACKGUARD,FLUSTERED,...,
TROUBADOUR,HAPPY,"The next beacon, of course! ",
TROUBADOUR,HAPPY,"&Troubadour gives Blackguard a wave in acknowledgement, grinning.",
TROUBADOUR,HAPPY,Blackguard is totally right - we've got a mission to complete!,
BLACKGUARD,NEUTRAL,"Hey, wait a second-",
LIGHTHOUSE,NEUTRAL,&I see Lighthouse elbow Blackguard to cut him off.,
BIRD,NEUTRAL,Ahem. ,
BIRD,NEUTRAL,"&The bird gives a cough, drawing my attention back to it and the beacon it perched itself onto.",
BIRD,NEUTRAL,"Dreamer, if you would?",
NARRATION,NEUTRAL,"&The bird tips its white head to the side as it peers down at us, expectant.",
DREAMER,NEUTRAL,Um. Well... here goes!,
NARRATION,NEUTRAL,"&I touch the beacon with the flat of my palm. Just like before, the cool stone begins to vibrate and buzz.",
SYSTEM,,[SHAKE],
NARRATION,NEUTRAL,&I brace yourself as the ground begins to shudder again.&,
SYSTEM,,[BEACONLIGHT],
NARRATION,NEUTRAL,&The golden glow erupts into a mighty pillar of light and the bird takes off into the sky again.&,
TROUBADOUR,EXCITED,WOW!,
LIGHTHOUSE,SMILE,It really is beautiful...,
LIGHTHOUSE,SMILE,Have you ever seen anything like it?,
BLACKGUARD,NEUTRAL,&Blackguard rolls his eyes with a snort.,
BLACKGUARD,NEUTRAL,"Yeah, you  ever seen a searchlight before?",
NARRATION,NEUTRAL,&I hear him grunt and look over just in time to see Lighthouse giving him a swat.,
DREAMER,SMILE,"If all the battles coming up are this easy, we'll be done in no time at all.",
TROUBADOUR,HAPPY,&Troubadour laughs as he begins back down the path.,
TROUBADOUR,HAPPY,"I think this is the beginning of an awesome new adventure - what's the rush, Dreamer?",
DREAMER,SMILE,There's no rush - it's just... we're almost halfway through already.,
TROUBADOUR,HAPPY,&Troubadour turns around to grin at you.&,
TROUBADOUR,HAPPY,"Well, we'll just have to enjoy the time we get - don't want it to end too soon, right?",
TROUBADOUR,HAPPY,What's the phrase again?,
TROUBADOUR,HAPPY,Stop to smell the flowers?,
TROUBADOUR,HAPPY,&He gives an exaggerated inhale before winking at me.,
BLACKGUARD,ANNOYED,I don't see what there's to even enjoy. ,
BLACKGUARD,ANNOYED,We're basically free labor for this-,
BLACKGUARD,ANNOYED,&Blackguard jabs a thumb at the bird gliding overhead.,
BLACKGUARD,ANNOYED,-big bleached chicken.,
LIGHTHOUSE,NEUTRAL,"Don't be rude, Blackguard.",
LIGHTHOUSE,NEUTRAL,Chickens can't fly. ,
LIGHTHOUSE,SMILE,And you can always form a union if you think our working conditions are unfair.,
LIGHTHOUSE,NEUTRAL,"Although, a union seems a little pointless with the fate of the world at stake.",
NARRATION,NEUTRAL,&I can't see her face but her amusement is more than obvious.,
NARRATION,NEUTRAL,"&I look up at the bird as it soars on ahead, not reacting to our conversations.&",
NARRATION,NEUTRAL,&The bird stays silent  for the duration of our travel as we walk on.&,
