TROUBADOUR,NEUTRAL,"Gosh, Dreamer, can you believe all of this?!"
DREAMER,NEUTRAL,"I really can't. It's a little frightening, if I'm being honest. "
TROUBADOUR,NEUTRAL,"Aww, come on, that's no way to look at it!"
DREAMER,NEUTRAL,Yeah? [PAUSE] And how should I look at it?
TROUBADOUR,NEUTRAL,"Well, there are no shoulds, okay? "
TROUBADOUR,NEUTRAL,"All I'm saying is, look around you. [PAUSE] What do you see?"
DREAMER,NEUTRAL,"Ahh, I mean, there's crumbling ruins-"
TROUBADOUR,NEUTRAL,"-ruins with character? With a little personality, yeah?"
DREAMER,NEUTRAL,"Sure, you could say that... and there's these designs on some of them, like runes- "

TROUBADOUR,NEUTRAL,To feel so alive?!
DREAMER,NEUTRAL,How do you figure?
TROUBADOUR,NEUTRAL,"Skin in the game, Dreamer! "
TROUBADOUR,NEUTRAL,"Life in the real world is training wheels, and plush pillows, and second chances. "
TROUBADOUR,NEUTRAL,"Out here, we fight for something greater, knowing we could die at any moment. "
DREAMER,NEUTRAL,"Yeah, that's what scares me-"
TROUBADOUR,NEUTRAL,-and that's what excites me!
TROUBADOUR,NEUTRAL,This is real. This is weighty. 
NARRATION,NEUTRAL,His pupils glint against the starlight as he looks up above.
