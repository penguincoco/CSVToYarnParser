BIRD,NEUTRAL,Here it is: the first of many! 
DREAMER,SUSPICIOUS,So this is what we're looking for?
BIRD,NEUTRAL,"""Dreamer, could you please press your palm against the stone?"""
BLACKGUARD,DETERMINED,And just why should she do that?
BIRD,NEUTRAL,"""I don't mean to be dramatic, but... well, failure to light the Beacons would cause the Lucid, and in turn your waking world, as we know it to unravel completely."""
DREAMER,SUSPICIOUS,Seriously?!
BIRD,NEUTRAL,I've said all I can on the matter and I can't force you to do anything. This choice is yours now.

NARRATION,NEUTRAL,&The Beacon sends a piercing ray of pure white into the sky.
NARRATION,NEUTRAL,"""&The light of the stone feels uneasy against my skin. It's like a raw arcane current, coursing through my body."""
LIGHTHOUSE,EXCITED,"""Well, that certainly leaves an impression, that's for sure."""
BIRD,NEUTRAL,"""And so the cycle continues! Thank you for your choice, Dreamer."""
NARRATION,NEUTRAL,"""&I smile and nod, but the word ""choice"" bounces around inside my head."""
