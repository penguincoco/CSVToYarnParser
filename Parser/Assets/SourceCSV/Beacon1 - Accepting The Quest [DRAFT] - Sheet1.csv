BIRD,Here it is. The first of many! ,
DREAMER,"What is this, exactly?",
BIRD,"Please, Dreamer, press your palm against the stone. ",
BLACKGUARD,"Can you answer her question? What are we getting ourselves into, here?",
TROUBADOR,"I can press it, if you like!",
BIRD,No. Dreamer is the only one who can light the beacon.,
DREAMER,Why should I light the beacon?,
BIRD,"Hahah, oh dear. After all these cycles, I thought I'd have grown used to the questions. ",
BLACKGUARD,It's a reasonable thing to ask. What if touching this thing blows it up? What if it lights Dreamer on fire?,
LIGHTHOUSE,"Oh, please, would the Bird really do something that awful?",
BIRD,"Let me put it simply, friends. Look up at the stars above. Do you see them, dreamer? ",
DREAMER,I do. ,
BIRD,Can you count the stars for me? How many are there?,
DREAMER,"I mean, I don't know, there's millions or billions of them-",
BIRD,"Yes! A near infinite amount of stars! That, Dreamer, is how many young people like yourselves who I've guided to the beacons. ",
TROUBADOR,"Wow! That's just, wow. Can you believe that?",
BLACKGUARD,I'm not sure we can believe anything this thing says. ,
LIGHTHOUSE,Blackguard!,
BIRD,"I understand your reservations. I only offer this to you, Dreamer, so you might extend me a bit of courtesy. I've answered questions like yours since time immemorial. ",
DREAMER,"You've shepharded millions of us, and nobody's ever said no?",
BIRD,"Haha, well... nobody has ever wanted to live with the consequences of saying no. ",
BLACKGUARD,What happens if we don't light the beacons?,
BIRD,"I don't intend to be dramatic, travelers, but... failure to light the beacons would cause the Universe as we know it to unravel completely.",
DREAMER,Seriously?,
BIRD,"Yes. The cycle must continue. So please, Dreamer, press your hand against the stone. ",
SYSTEM,"[ENDNODE: ""Beacon1.Quest1""]",
NOTE,"Maybe here we give DRMR the option of approaching Bird, TBDR, BLCK, and LGHT, offering a line from each as they give their opinion on whether DRMR should light the beacon. ",

SYSTEM,"[NODE: ""Beacon1.Quest2""]",
NOTE,"""Approach Blackguard after completing Beacon1Quest.1""",
BLACKGUARD,"I'd be careful about touching that thing. Although I'm not so sure we have an option here, which is bullshit. ",

TROUBADOR,Oh my gosh...,
BLACKGUARD,Stand back!,
SYSTEM,[SHAKE],
NARRATION,The beacon sends a piercing ray of violet into the sky. ,
NARRATION,"The light of the stone feels uneasy against my skin. It's like a weak electrical current, coursing through my body. ",
LIGHTHOUSE,"God, that looks beautiful. ",
NARRATION,The Bird perches itself on my shoulder. ,
BIRD,"The cycle continues! Thank you for your choice, Dreamer. ",
