SYSTEM,"[NODE: ""Lobby1Person.TBDR1""]"
NOTE,Main Troubadour node.
TROUBADOUR,Isn't this exciting!
DREAMER,Exciting?
TROUBADOUR,It's like we are superheros tasked with saving humanity! 
DREAMER,I'm not sure I see it that way ...aren't you scared?
TROUBADOUR,"Scared? Sure, but would we be here if we weren't capable? "
TROUBADOUR,I think it's all meant to be
DREAMER,But if we fail...the Universe will unravel. That's a pretty hefty task for a few teenagers.
TROUBADOUR,Don't be such a downer! If we succeed we will be remembered forever! So don’t worry so much.
DREAMER,I can't help but worry. What if we can't complete what we are meant to? We were barely able to destroy the beacon 
TROUBADOUR,It will get easier with time.
TROUBADOUR,Soon we will be fighting evil like real superheroes!
NARRATION,&What's so exciting about being a superhero? It seems like a lot of responsibility.&
DREAMER,Aren't you curious as to why we are here?
TROUBADOUR,"Duh, we're special. I don’t see why it's such a big deal."
TROUBADOUR,"We have an opportunity to do something great, we should embrace it!"
DREAMER,...
TROUBADOUR,I won't lie-- I wish I could do more. Maybe if I apply myself I can be granted with more than just healing
TROUBADOUR,I don't want to just sit back and watch everyone else fight
TROUBADOUR,I want to be part of the action! I want more than what's been given...it feels a little unfair. That all-knowing bird should recognize my talents! 
DREAMER,Everyone has a role to play and healing is a big one.
TROUBADOUR,"Sure, but look at Blackguard. He doesn't even want to be here and yet he gets to be part of so much more! "
DREAMER,You think he's undeserving? Didn't you say it's all meant to be?
TROUBADOUR,...
DREAMER,Are you sure you're alright? We did just fight a bunch of monsters.
TROUBADOUR,"I know wasn't it cool! One minute we were like ""ah!"" and then the next we were absolutely owning them! "
NARRATION,He seems a little aloof. I guess Lighthouse was right about him being positive.
TROUBADOUR,It wouldn't be an adventure if it wasn't scary at times! We all have our doubts but what's the harm in trying to think positively? 
TROUBADOUR,Being all doom and gloom _like someone we know_ won't get us anywhere. So chin up! 
TROUBADOUR,"It's better we just trust the bird than get all exist-, exists-...hmmm..."
NOTE,TBDR seems to struggle a bit with speaking. DRMR decides to help him a bit by finishing his sentence.
DREAMER,Existstential? 
TROUBADOUR,Yes! Exactly. Existential. 
DREAMER,I guess you're right. We're here now. Not much we can do about our situation but move forward. Can't cry over spilled milk...
TROUBADOUR,Hmm? WHAT? You can totally cry over spilled milk! _I_ would bawl if I spilled my milk...
DREAMER,...that's not exactly what I meant.
NOTE,TBDR distractedly walks off...mesmorized by the surrounding area cutting off the rest of your conversation.
NOTE,Troubadour starts walking away.
DREAMER,Where are you—and off he goes.
